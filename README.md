# About

I LOVE Foundation and have been using it for about 4 years now, I love its flexibility, responsivness metro design as it makes a great base for responsive web applications and so when Zurb announced they were releasing a new version with an upgraded flexbox grid and more ! I was so happy, Up untill the point were I found out they were dropping quite alot of features such as the famous responsive topbar.

To say the least this has annoyed me because my existing project used topbar as their main source of navigation throughout the site, and so I took it to hand to merge the 2 versions FoundationApps & FoundationSites to create foundationUltra
